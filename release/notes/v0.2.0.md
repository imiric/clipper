This is a major rethinking of the extension, with the following changes:

## Features

- 6463dc1: Instead of using a single static Org Mode template, it's now possible to
  use different templates, to customize them, and add new ones. This makes the
  extension much more flexible and generally useful. Templates for Org Mode and
  Markdown are provided out-of-the-box.

  The options UI is implemented using [a small data-binding library](https://github.com/hackfixme/miu) built for this use case.

- abcb439: Given the more generalized functionality, the extension was renamed from
  Org Clipper to Clipper.


## Internal

- bc9a121: Replace Makefile with justfile.
